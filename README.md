### Install

This project requires  **Python 3.x**  and the following Python libraries installed:

-   [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
-   [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
-   [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
-   [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
-   [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an  [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

We recommend to install  [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory and run one of the following commands:

ipython notebook 2. Define the Network Architecture.ipynb

or

jupyter notebook 2. Define the Network Architecture.ipynb

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data

The dataset for this project originates from the COCO API, and contains images and their cpation.
**Target**

-   `generate`: Generating captioning for an image
